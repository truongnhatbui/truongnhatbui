# **Truong** 

Analyst. Advisor. Architect.

I am passionate about the opportunities resulting from the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Digital Innovation, Digital Transformation and Modern Infrastructure.

In my +13 years of industry experience spanning the leading software product & outsourcing, Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company. I worked extensively with Enterprises, Independent Software Vendors (ISV), and Startups, which helps in delivering value to my companies and clients.

I provided [Market Research](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/market-research) Analysis, Industry Trends, Technology Assessment, Vendor Evaluation, and Strategic Advisory for my companies and clients. I helped in defining the [User Personas](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/user-persona), identifying the target audience, and selecting appropriate channels to engage with them. I enabled my clients to amplify the message and maximize outreach. Furthermore, I also played the role of a consulting [product manager](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/product-manager). From identifying the market opportunity to creating specifications to developing a [Proof of Concept (POC)](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/poc) to collaborating with the engineering team, I can manage the [entire product lifecycle](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/azure-devops).

My current focus is on in-depth research and analysis of Emerging Technologies, Digital Transformation, Strategic Advisory to product companies, and architecting scalable applications based on [Cloud Native Architecture](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/cloud-native-application-architecture?utm_source=truongbui.com&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=skills&utm_term=cloud&utm_content=textlink) ([Containers & Microservices](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/container-orchestration-kubernetes)).

To keep myself relevant and current, I regularly pursue [industry certifications](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/licenses-certifications) and learn [courses](https://www.truongbui.com/posts/courses).
